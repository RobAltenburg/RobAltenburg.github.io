fedreg-search
==============

Searches the Federal Register for documents from selected agencies that have opened public comment periods between the day checked and the prior Monday.

The original javascript using jquery was reimplemented in clojurescript using google.visualization.table

To change the list of agencies that are searched you need to edit the variables "agencies" and "agency-to-abbr".
