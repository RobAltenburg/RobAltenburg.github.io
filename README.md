fedreg-search
==============

Searches the Federal Register for documents from selected agencies that have opened public comment periods between the day checked and the prior Monday.

This is a quick-and-dirty version from someone who writes almost nothing in javascript, so massive improvements are probably achievable.


To change the list of selected agencies, you need to edit "myURL" and "agencies".

(The "agencies" variable is just there to translate long names to initials like "EPA".)
